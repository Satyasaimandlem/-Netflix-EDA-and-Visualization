****Netflix-EDA-and-Visualization****

In the Netflix dataset exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify trends and insights. This involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, visualizing the distribution of various attributes, and computing statistical summaries to gain insights into the data.

First, the data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy. Missing values, outliers, and duplicate data were removed or imputed as appropriate. Next, data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots were used to explore the distribution and relationships between variables. For instance, the distribution of ratings, the most popular genres, and the frequency of releases over time were visualized to identify trends.

Finally, statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression modeling were used to identify relationships and patterns in the data. For example, a regression analysis was used to identify the relationship between the number of ratings and the overall rating of a movie or TV show.

Through this EDA project, insights were gained into the trends and patterns in the Netflix dataset, providing valuable information for future analysis and decision-making.
